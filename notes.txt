So When I install express using npm i express then it is added in dependencies in package.json,
so the question arizes what is package.json ? 

** 
   The package.json file is the core configuration 
   file of a Node.js project that stores project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.It allows 
   easy management of packages and lets others install and run your project with commands like 
   npm install and npm run. 
**

**
So now the thing is that when you install express js then you can see in dependencies that its shows like this 
^5.1.0, we know this is express version but why it shows three times like 5 then 1 then 0 so I explain you this,
so basically 


5 --> Major version ( when very crticial changes made in express)
1 --> Minor Version (when some minor changes made in express like add any functionality)
0 --> Patch Version (It shows very-very small changes in express like any small bug fix)
^ --> This sign is called as Caret,It tells npm which versions of the package are acceptable when installing or updating

like in the ^5.1.0 --> npm can install any version greater than or equal to 5.1.0 but less than 6.0.0.
(So it allows updates to minor and patch versions, but not major ones.)


if you see any version which shows like this ~5.1.0 then it means -->npm can install versions greater than or equal to 5.1.0 but less than 5.2.0.
(So it only allows patch updates, not minor or major updates.)
**


** Then one question arizes that when you install express then node modules also insatll so what is this,
so node modules basically insatll the express code and all of its dependencies, like you can go to node modules
and check there is an exprees folder and you can see there is a package.json file in it and when you go to it 
then you see there are lot of dependencies are there and you can see that all dependencies are also installed in
node_modules **


**
now what is package-lock.json --> It locks the exact versions of all installed packages (and their sub-dependencies).
